The file is a SQL source file. To install it, you should execute it on your MySQL server.

Either:

- Within MySQL, issue:
mysql> SOURCE '/path/to/common_schema.sql';

- From shell, execute:
bash$ mysql < '/path/to/common_schema.sql'

- Use your favorite MySQL GUI editor, copy+paste file content, execute.
