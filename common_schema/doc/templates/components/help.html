<h3>NAME</h3>
help(): Search and read <i>common_schema</i> documentation.

<h3>TYPE</h3>
Procedure

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
	<i>help()</i> is a meta routine allowing access to documentation from within
	<i>common_schema</i> itself.	
</p>
<p>
	The documentation, including, for example, this very page, is embedded within
	<i>common_schema</i>'s tables, such that it can be searched and read using
	standard SQL queries.
</p>
<p>
	<i>help()</i> accepts a search term, and presents a single documentation page
	which best fits the term. The term may appear within the documentation's title
	or description. It could be the name or part of name of one of 
	<i>common_schema</i>'s components (routines, views, ...), or it could be any
	keyword appearing within the documentation.
</p>
<p>
	The output is MySQL-friendly, in that it breaks the documentation into rows of
	text, thereby presenting the result in a nicely formatted table.
</p>

| MySQL does not provide with identification of logged in accounts. It only     |
| provides with user + host:port combination within processlist. Alas, these do |
| not directly map to accounts, as MySQL lists the host:port from which the     |
| connection is made, but not the (possibly wildcard) user or host.             |
| This function matches a user+host combination against the known accounts,     |
| using the same matching method as the MySQL server, to detect the account     |
| which MySQL identifies as the one matching. It is similar in essence to       |
| CURRENT_USER(), only it works for all sessions, not just for the current      |
| session.                                                                      |
