<p>
<strong>sleep</strong>: suspend execution for a given number of seconds
</p>

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<p>
<blockquote><pre>sleep &lt;number&gt;;
sleep $seconds;
sleep @seconds;
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p> 
<i>sleep</i> is a QueryScript <a href="query_script_statements.html">statement</a> which,
when invoked, makes for a non-busy wait for a given period of time. Essentially, it is a convenience
statement making for a shortcut to a "DO
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_sleep">SLEEP()</a>" execution.
</p>
<p>
<i>sleep</i> takes a number as a parameter, which is the time, in seconds, for which the script is to sleep.
The number can be an integer or a floating point, and it is interpreted as follows:
<ul>
	<li><strong>0 or less</strong>: no sleep is done. It makes no sense to provide such values</li>
	<li><strong>x, a positive number</strong>: sleep for given number of seconds.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<i>sleep</i> also accepts a local variable or a MySQL user defined variable as argument. 
Such argument is cast to a number and handled as specified above. 
</p>

<h3>EXAMPLES</h3>

<p>
Purge rows from table, sleep for <strong>2</strong> seconds in between operations:
<blockquote><pre>
while (delete from world.City limit 10)
{
  sleep 2.0;
}
</pre></blockquote>
</p>
