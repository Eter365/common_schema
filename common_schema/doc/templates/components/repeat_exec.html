<h3>NAME</h3>
repeat_exec(): Repeatedly executes given query or queries until some condition holds.

<h3>TYPE</h3>
Procedure

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
This procedure repeats execution of query or queries, on a given interval. It terminates according
to a given condition, which may be one of several types (see following), including dynamic calculation.
</p>
<p>
The procedure is essentially a <i>repeat-until</i> looping device. It is tailored to fit common
use case scenarios, such as <i>repeat-until no more rows are affected</i> or 
<i>repeat-until some time has passed</i>. 
Use cases range from breaking down huge transactions to smaller ones,
through load testing, to data access & manipulation simulation. 
</p>
<p>
It calls upon <i>exec()</i> for query execution.
Queries may be of varying types (DML, DDL, other commands). See <a href="exec.html">exec()</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Invoker of this procedure must have the privileges required for execution of given queries.
</p>

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<p>
<blockquote><pre>repeat_exec(interval_seconds DOUBLE, execute_queries TEXT CHARSET utf8, stop_condition TEXT CHARSET utf8)</pre></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Input:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>interval_seconds</strong>: number of seconds to sleep between invocation of queries.
    	<br/>This value can be a floating point number, e.g. <strong>0.1</strong> indicates one-tenth of a second.
    	<br/><i>repeat_exec()</i> begins with query execution, then follows on to sleeping. Once the 
    	<strong>stop_condition</strong> is met, no more sleeping is performed. 
    </li>
    <li><strong>execute_queries</strong>: one or more queries to execute per loop iteration.
    	<br/>If more than one query specified, all queries <i>including last</i> must terminate with
    	a semicolon (<strong>;</strong>)
    </li>
    <li><strong>stop_condition</strong>: the condition by which the loop terminates. Can be in one
    	of several forms and formats:
    	<ul>
    		<li><strong>NULL</strong>: no stop condition. The loop is infinite.</li>
    		<li><strong>0</strong>: The loop terminates when no rows are affected by query (if
	    		multiple queries specified, loop terminates when no rows are affected by last of queries).
    			This is in particular useful for DELETE or UPDATE statements, see examples.
    		</li>
    		<li><strong>A positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...)</strong>: loop terminates after given number
    			of iterations.
    		</li>
    		<li><strong>Short time format (e.g. '30s', '45m', '2h')</strong>: loop terminates after
    			specified time has passed. See <a href="shorttime_to_seconds.html">shorttime_to_seconds()</a>
    			for more on <i>short time</i> format.
    		</li>
    		<li><strong>a SELECT query</strong>: query is re-evaluated at the end of each iteration.
    			Loop terminates when query evaluates to a TRUE value. The query must return with one
    			single row and one single value.
    		</li>
    	</ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Since the routines relies on <a href="exec.html">exec()</a>, it accepts the following
  input config:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>@common_schema_dryrun</strong>: when <strong>1</strong>, queries are not executed, but rather printed.</li>
    <li><strong>@common_schema_verbose</strong>: when <strong>1</strong>, queries are verbosed.</li>
  </ul>
  Output:
  <ul>
    <li>Whatever output the queries may produce.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>EXAMPLES</h3>
	<p>
		DELETE all rows matching some condition. Break a potentially huge DELETE (e.g. 500,000 rows)
		into smaller chunks, as follows:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>sleep_time</strong> is <strong>2</strong> seconds</li>
			<li><strong>execute_queries</strong> only deletes <strong>1000</strong> rows at a time</li>
			<li><strong>stop_condition</strong> is set to <strong>0</strong>, meaning the query
				terminates when no more rows are affected, i.e., all matching rows have been
				deleted.</li>
		</ul>
		This makes for smaller transactions, less locks, and better replication slave catch-up:
	</p>
	<blockquote><pre>mysql&gt; call repeat_exec(2, 
	  'DELETE FROM sakila.rental WHERE customer_id=7 ORDER BY rental_id LIMIT 1000', 
	  0);
</pre></blockquote>
	<p>
		Make a <strong>15</strong> seconds random INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE access pattern:
	</p>
	<blockquote><pre>mysql&gt; call repeat_exec(0.01, 
	  'UPDATE world.City SET Name=MD5(RAND()) WHERE id=FLOOR(RAND()*4000); INSERT INTO world.City (Name, Population) VALUES (MD5(RAND()), 0); DELETE FROM world.City WHERE id=FLOOR(RAND()*4000);', 
	  '15s');
</pre></blockquote>
	<p>
		Execute a query until some dynamic condition holds:
	</p>
	<blockquote><pre>mysql&gt; call repeat_exec(0.5, 
	  'DELETE FROM sakila.rental WHERE customer_id=7 ORDER BY rental_id LIMIT 100', 
	  'SELECT SUM(customer_id = 7) < SUM(customer_id = 3) FROM sakila.rental');
</pre></blockquote>
