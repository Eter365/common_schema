this_query(): Returns the current query executed by this thread.
<h3>TYPE</h3>
Function

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
	This function returns the text of query which is now executing under the
	current process.
</p>
<p>
	Essentially, it is the very same query which invoked this function. That it,
	the call to <i>this_query()</i> is expected to be found within the result's text.
</p>
<p>
	The function is provided as ground for future query/text analysis routines
	which would be able to modify query behavior according to query's text.
</p>
