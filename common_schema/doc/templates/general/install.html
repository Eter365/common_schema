<p><i>common_schema</i> distribution file is a SQL source file.  To install it, you should execute it on your MySQL server.</p>

<p>There are many ways to import a SQL file into MySQL, listed below. 
<strong>Make sure</strong> to execute them as a privileged user, e.g. <strong>'root'@'localhost'</strong>, as installation involves creation of schema, tables, views &amp; routines. </p>

<p>There are several <i>common_schema</i> distribution options, depending on your MySQL server version. Consult the <a href="download">download page</a></p>
<ul>
	<li>Within MySQL, issue (replace <i>"common_schema_distribution_file"</i> with actual file name):
		<br/>
		<blockquote><pre>mysql&gt; SOURCE '/path/to/common_schema_distribution_file.sql';</pre></blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>From shell, execute:
		<br/>
		<blockquote><pre>bash$ mysql < /path/to/common_schema_distribution_file.sql</pre></blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>Use your favorite MySQL GUI editor, copy+paste file content, execute.</li>
</ul>

<p>To verify installation, check that the <strong>common_schema</strong> database exists. e.g.:</p>
<blockquote><pre>root@mysql&gt; SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| common_schema      |
| mysql              |
| sakila             |
| world              |
+--------------------+
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>Since installation is merely an import act, you should only expect trouble if
schema generation is unable to execute on your server.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Are you executing on a <strong>5.0</strong> MySQL server? This version is not supported.</li>
	<li>Are you trying to import the innodb_plugin version of <i>common_schema</i> on
	a server where innodb_plugin is disabled?</li>
	<li>Are you trying to import the innodb_plugin version of <i>common_schema</i> on
	a server where innodb_plugin is enabled, but not all plugin's modules are loaded? 
	Each innodb_plugin INFORMATION_SCHEMA table is its own plugin; you should enable them all.</li>
	<li>Are you trying to import the Percona Server version of <i>common_schema</i> on
	a standard MySQL server? This won't work</li> 
	<li>Are you trying to import the Percona Server version of <i>common_schema</i> on
	a Percona server where INNODB_INDEX_STATS is not enabled?</li>
