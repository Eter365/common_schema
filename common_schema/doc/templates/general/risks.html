<p>This is not the usual "It's your responsibility" stuff. Please read through.</p>

<p>
<i>common_schema</i> is a database schema. It includes routines, views and tables. 
The risks of using this schema are those affected by issuing queries against its views or routines.
</p>

<p>
In particular, most of the views rely on INFORMATION_SCHEMA views.
</p>

<p>
MySQL's INFORMATION_SCHEMA views are not all equal. Some are pretty lightweight (like PROCESSLIST); 
some take a bit more time to evaluate (like GLOBAL_STATUS) but do not impose locks affecting your data. 
</p>

<p>Some views, however, require getting metadata for tables, and in fact, require metadata for all
tables at once. First and foremost: the TABLES table, but also COLUMNS, STATISTICS etc. 
Performing even the simplest query on one of these views may cause, in extreme cases, lockdown of
your database for long minutes. The author has also witnessed databases crash because of
queries on such tables.

</p>

<p>It is safer to perform such heavyweight queries on a replicating slave. A slave may actually
sustain less "damage" from these queries due to its single-threaded writing mode, making for
less contention on table locks. At least this is the author's experience; no guarantees made.</p>

<p>
The good news is that those views relying on heavyweight INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables are those
you don't mind running on the slave, or on an offline machine. These views usually analyze your
table structure, data size, keys, AUTO_INCREMENT columns, etc. They don't have anything in particular
for monitoring a live, running server. Some of these views don't actually require data to work on, just a schema.
</p>

<p>Examples of <i>common_schema</i> views which rely on heavyweight INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a title="no_pk_innodb_tables" href="no_pk_innodb_tables.html">no_pk_innodb_tables</a></li>
	<li><a title="redundant_keys" href="redundant_keys.html">redundant_keys</a></li>
	<li><a title="sql_alter_table" href="sql_alter_table.html">sql_alter_table</a></li>
	<li><a title="sql_foreign_keys" href="sql_foreign_keys.html">sql_foreign_keys</a></li>
	<li><a title="table_charset" href="table_charset.html">table_charset</a></li>
	<li><a title="text_columns" href="text_columns.html">text_columns</a></li>
	<li><a title="auto_increment_columns" href="auto_increment_columns.html">auto_increment_columns</a></li>

	<li><a title="innodb_index_rows" href="innodb_index_rows.html">innodb_index_rows</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The list above may change, or may not reflect the actual state of views & functions.</p>

<p><i>common_schema</i> views which are <i>lightweight</i> are the various 
  <a title="process" href="process_views.html">process</a>, 
  <a title="security" href="security_views.html">security</a>, 
  <a title="monitoring" href="monitoring_views.html">monitoring</a>,

  <a title="Percona Server" href="percona_server_views.html">Percona Server</a> views. 
</p>

<p>Of course, just as would be able to drop your database being a super user, you could also
use <i>common_schema</i> to execute destructive queries. Many routines support the 
<strong>@common_schema_dryrun</strong> user variable; use it (set it to <strong>1</strong>) 
if you're not sure about expected results.</p>

<p>You should also note that <i>"common_schema"</i> is hard coded into the distribution files; 
if you have a schema after the same name, make sure to change <i>"common_schema"</i> in the distribution file.</p>
