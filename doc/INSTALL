The common_schema distribution file is a SQL source file. To install it, you should execute it on your MySQL server.

Either:

- Within MySQL, issue:
mysql> SOURCE '/path/to/common_schema.sql';

- From shell, execute:
bash$ mysql < '/path/to/common_schema.sql'

- Use your favorite MySQL GUI editor, copy+paste file content, execute.




REQUIREMENTS
=======================================

On some MySQL versions a stack size of 256K is required (though may work for 192K as well).
256K is the default stack size as of 5.5.
You should review/edit the following in your MySQL config file; change will only take
place after MySQL restart

[mysqld]
thread_stack = 256K
