<p><i>common_schema</i> distribution file is a SQL source file.  To install it, you should execute it on your MySQL server.</p>

<p>There are many ways to import a SQL file into MySQL, listed below. 
<strong>Make sure</strong> to execute them as a privileged user, e.g. <strong>'root'@'localhost'</strong>, as installation involves creation of schema, tables, views &amp; routines.</p>

<p>Consult the <a href="download.html">download page</a> for obtaining the <i>common_schema</i> distribution file.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Within MySQL, issue (replace <i>"common_schema_distribution_file"</i> with actual file name):
		<br/>
		<blockquote><pre>mysql&gt; SOURCE '/path/to/common_schema_distribution_file.sql';</pre></blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>From shell, execute:
		<br/>
		<blockquote><pre>bash$ mysql < /path/to/common_schema_distribution_file.sql</pre></blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>Use your favorite MySQL GUI editor, copy+paste file content, execute.</li>
</ul>

<p>To verify installation, check that the <strong>common_schema</strong> database exists. e.g.:</p>
<blockquote><pre>root@mysql&gt; SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| common_schema      |
| mysql              |
| sakila             |
| world              |
+--------------------+
</pre></blockquote>


<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>The <i>common_schema</i> distribution file supports MySQL 
	<strong>5.1</strong>, 
	<strong>5.5</strong> and 
	<strong>5.6</strong>, 
	Oracle distribution, Percona Server and MariaDB.
</p>


<p>
	Percona Server features are supported for versions >= <strong>5.5.8</strong>. 
	TokuDB features are supported on TokuDB enabled servers.
	Please note that <i>common_schema</i> will install regardless of the version. 
	It will automatically recognize available feature set and install accordingly.
	Likewise, it will install regardless of the availability of InnoDB Plugin and 
	associated INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables.
</p>

<p>
	If you should upgrade your MySQL server, or enable features which were turned off during install of <i>common_schema</i>,
	the new feature set are not automatically available by <i>common_schema</i>, and a re-install of <i>common_schema</i> is required.
</p>

<h3>Installation notes</h3>

<p>
	The installation process drops and creates various tables and routines. In particular,
	the installation process breaks any running <a href="query_script.html">QueryScript</a> code. 
	Avoid installing <i>common_schema</i> during QueryScript executions.
</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>Since installation is merely an import act, you should only expect trouble if
schema generation is unable to execute on your server.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Are you executing on a <strong>5.0</strong> MySQL server? This version is not supported.</li>
	<li>Were errors reported during installation process?</li>
	<li>What was <i>common_schema</i>'s last message during install?</li>
	<li>What is the output of <strong>SELECT * FROM common_schema.status</strong>?</li>
</ul>
